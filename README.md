# Learning-Python

So far I added one python code here is what I have to say about it :

This is my first Python code, I am coming from MATLAB, Maple and LaTeX.

This code is more complex than it needs to be, and I used someone's code to find the proper factors (I did test it).

The code should just run, you need to change the starting number to your preferred integer starting number.
Features :
*I have a few interesting starting numbers that are commented out.
*The code will use a hard coded a smaller max iteration for starting number 220 because of a small loop in the output.
*It will use log plot if the sequence has a number bigger than 300

The next step is for me to write my own factorization function and figure out how to plot multiple lines on a graph (without copying and pasting the solution from a user or a LLM) and some simplifications like adding break instead of using my diverge parameter.
